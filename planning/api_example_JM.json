  "description":"The latest development in money uses cryptography to seek to ensure trust and fungibility in a theoretically tamper-proof distributed ledger called a blockchain. While several digital currency systems where proposed since the 1980s,the first successful decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was proposed in 2008 by an unknown author or authors under the pseudonym of Satoshi Nakamoto.The protocol proposed by Nakamoto solved what is known as the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted third-party.

Since bitcoin's inception, thousands of other cryptocurrencies have been introduced,[67][68] many of which use the symbology of former metallic currencies, such as silver for Litecoin.",
